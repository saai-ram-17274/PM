# V5 Entity Slider — Data Source & AI Enrichment Mapping

> **Generated**: 07 May 2026
> **Purpose**: Maps every field in the V5 Alert Investigation entity slider to **(a)** its backend source in our product (Log360 Cloud / Log360 / EventLog Analyzer / ADAudit Plus / ADManager Plus), and **(b)** what additional context **AI agents** can fetch to enrich the same field.
> **Source of truth**: [`js/data/entities.js`](js/data/entities.js) (20 entities) + tab config in [`js/modules/entity-slider.js`](js/modules/entity-slider.js#L189) (6 entity types).
> **Companion doc**: [relation_catalog.md](relation_catalog.md) — the 24 canonical edge relations used in the graph.

## Legend

| Symbol | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| ✅ | Data exists in product backend — implementable today |
| 🟡 | Partial — needs aggregation, schema extension, or new collector |
| ❌ | Not in product — needs new feature or third-party integration |
| 🤖 | AI-fetchable — LLM/agent can enrich from external/public sources |
| 🤖✚ | AI-derivable — LLM can compute from product data (summary, classification, scoring) |

**AI-Enrichment column** lists what an AI agent (e.g. via tool-calling to VirusTotal, Shodan, MITRE ATT&CK, WHOIS, threat-feed APIs, or pure LLM reasoning over collected logs) can add **on top of** the product field.

### 1.1 Risk Summary (`riskSummary`)

| Field | Status | Product Source | How to Get | AI Enrichment |
|-------|--------|----------------|------------|---------------|
| Risk Score (0–100) | ✅ | `ITSEntityRiskScoreDetails.RISK_SCORE` (Log360) | `RiskScoreHandler` — computed `MODIFIED_SCORE × SEVERITY_SCORE`, cached in Redis | 🤖✚ AI can re-rank by considering the **full alert chain context** (e.g. boost score if entity also appears in a parallel attack-path graph) |
| Severity | ✅ | Stored as `ITSEntityRiskScoreDetails.SESSION_SEVERITY` (INTEGER bucket id). Human label resolved via lookup join `ITSRiskSeverityDetails.SEVERITY_NAME WHERE SEVERITY_ID = SESSION_SEVERITY` → `CRITICAL` / `ATTENTION` / `TROUBLE`. The join is a convention — there is **no FK declared** in [`data-dictionary.xml`](../../../REPOS/itsf/product_package/conf/itsf/common/riskscore/data-dictionary.xml). The bucket itself is selected per-event via `LIKE_LI_HOOD_SEVERITY` mapping in [`RiskScoreHandler.java`](../../../REPOS/itsf/source/java_source/com/manageengine/itsf/common/riskscore/handler/RiskScoreHandler.java#L33-L34) (NOT mapped from score thresholds). | Lookup join | 🤖✚ AI suggests severity-vs-blast-radius adjustment |
| Status Badge ("Compromised Account") | 🟡 | Computed from anomaly types | Aggregate `ITSAlertProfileConfigurations` rule categories | 🤖✚ AI generates a one-line **verdict** ("Compromised", "Insider", "Misconfigured") from log evidence |
| Active Anomalies — session / lifetime | ✅ | `ITSEntityRiskScoreDetails.DETECTION_COUNT` (session, decays via `DecayHandler`) + `OVERALL_DETECTION_COUNT` (true lifetime tally — incremented `+1` per anomaly in [`RiskScoreHandler.java`](../../../REPOS/itsf/source/java_source/com/manageengine/itsf/common/riskscore/handler/RiskScoreHandler.java#L42), never decays, never resets) | Raw DB | 🤖✚ AI compares lifetime count vs peer baseline → "top 5% of users" repeat-offender label |
| Failed Logins (24h) | ✅ | Elasticsearch `eventid=4625` | Aggregated ES query on Windows Security logs | 🤖✚ AI clusters failures by source IP and labels each cluster (brute-force vs misconfig vs typo) |
| Last Anomaly | ✅ | `ITSEntityRiskScoreDetails.LAST_ANOMALY_UPDATE_TIME` — running `Math.max()` on every event in [`RiskScoreHandler.java`](../../../REPOS/itsf/source/java_source/com/manageengine/itsf/common/riskscore/handler/RiskScoreHandler.java#L47). Long-term storage, not bounded by ES retention. | `now() - LAST_ANOMALY_UPDATE_TIME`, humanized | — |
| ~~Dwell Time~~ — **REMOVED** | ❌ | No `FIRST_ANOMALY_TIME` column in `ITSEntityRiskScoreDetails`; the handler captures only the running max, not the min. ES `min(@timestamp)` is bounded by retention so silently truncates. Removed from the user summary card to avoid misleading numbers. To bring back: add `FIRST_ANOMALY_TIME BIGINT` to [`data-dictionary.xml`](../../../REPOS/itsf/product_package/conf/itsf/common/riskscore/data-dictionary.xml) and set it once on row insert in [`RiskScoreUtil.java`](../../../REPOS/itsf/source/java_source/com/manageengine/itsf/common/riskscore/util/RiskScoreUtil.java#L70). | — | — |
| Hero chip — **Last Logon** | ✅ | `ADSUserDetails.lastLogonTime` (ADAP — real DB column, never retention-bounded for users). Renders as a single chip via `summaryCard.heroChips[]` in [entity-slider.js](js/modules/entity-slider.js) (generic hook — other entity types can fill `heroChips` with their own schema-honest fields). | LDAP-synced into RDBMS | — |
| ~~First Seen / Last Activity~~ — **REMOVED from user hero** | ❌ | Was sourced from ES `min/max(_zl_timestamp)` filtered by entity. `MIN()` is silently truncated by log retention so it can't honestly answer *"when did the platform first observe this user"*. Replaced by the single **Last Logon** chip above. The renderer keeps the legacy `firstSeen` / `lastActivity` fields as a fallback so non-user entities (which haven't been re-reviewed yet) continue to render. | — | — |

### 1.2 User Details (`usersDetails`)

> **Cloud surface — verified.** Log360 Cloud uses APF discovery tables for full identity attributes, with `ELADomainUserDetails` only as a thin discovery-time index. Picked based on whether the entity is an AD user or an Entra/M365 user. Resolution paths verified in [`UserDetailsUtil.java`](../../../REPOS/itsf/source/java_source/com/manageengine/itsf/common/incident/workbench/tab/util/UserDetailsUtil.java) and the attribute manifest at [`APFADUserAttributes.xml`](../../../REPOS/ADSF-DD-DML/product_package/conf/adsf/common/appfw/applications/attributes/ad/APFADUserAttributes.xml).
>
> | Source | Table | Holds | Notes |
> |---|---|---|---|
> | AD-discovered users (rich) | [`APFDiscADUserDetails`](../../../REPOS/ADSF-DD-DML/product_package/conf/adsf/common/appfw/discovery/application/ad/data-dictionary.xml#L168) | ~120 columns: identity (NAME, FIRST_NAME, LAST_NAME, DISPLAY_NAME, FULL_NAME, COMMON_NAME, SAM_ACCOUNT_NAME, LOGON_NAME, EMAIL_ADDRESS), org (TITLE, DEPARTMENT, MANAGER, MANAGER_DN, COMPANY, OFFICE, EMPLOYEE_ID, EMPLOYEE_NUMBER, DIRECT_REPORTS), location (STREET_ADDRESS, CITY, STATE_PROVINCE, COUNTRY, ZIP_POSTAL_CODE), AD plumbing (DISTINGUISHED_NAME, OU_NAME, OU_DN_NAME, OU_UNIQUE_ID, DOMAIN_NAME, PRIMARY_GROUP_ID, SID_STRING, OBJECT_GUID), security (USER_ACCOUNT_CONTROL, ACCOUNT_STATUS, ACCOUNT_EXPIRY_DATE, LOCK_OUT_TIME, BAD_PASSWORD_COUNT, BAD_PASSWORD_TIME, PASSWORD_LAST_SET, PWD_NEV_EXP_FLAG, CAN_NOT_CHANGE_PWD, TRUSTED_FOR_DELEGATION, SMART_CARD_FOR_INTERACTIVE_LOGIN), logon (LAST_LOGON_TIME, LAST_LOGON_TIMESTAMP, DAYS_SINCE_LAST_LOGON, LAST_LOGOFF_TIME, LOGON_COUNT, LOGON_TO, LOGON_HOURS), lifecycle (WHEN_CREATED, WHEN_CHANGED, IS_DELETED), Exchange/LCS/RADIUS/TS extensions | **The real AD user table for cloud.** Discovered via APF AD application; attribute mapping declared in `APFADUserAttributes.xml`. |
> | AD discovery index (thin) | [`ELADomainUserDetails`](../../../REPOS/itsf/product_package/conf/itsf/common/LogCollection/discovery/data-dictionary.xml#L299) | OBJECT_GUID, OBJECT_SID, NAME, SAMACCOUNTNAME, USERPRINCIPALNAME, DISTINGUISHEDNAME, OBJECTROOT_DN, USERACCOUNTCONTROL, EMAIL_ID, DOMAIN_ID | Used by [`UserDetailsUtil.getUserObjectGUID()`](../../../REPOS/itsf/source/java_source/com/manageengine/itsf/common/incident/workbench/tab/util/UserDetailsUtil.java#L56) only to resolve `(domain, username) → OBJECT_GUID`. Not a full identity table — full attributes live in `APFDiscADUserDetails`. |
> | Entra / M365 users | [`APFDiscAADUserDetails`](../../../REPOS/ADSF-DD-DML/product_package/conf/adsf/common/appfw/discovery/application/azure/data-dictionary.xml#L177) | OBJECT_ID, IDENTITY, FIRST_NAME, LAST_NAME, USER_PRINCIPAL_NAME, DISPLAY_NAME, EMAIL_ADDRESS, PHONE_NUMBER, MOBILE_PHONE, TITLE, DEPARTMENT, COMPANY, OFFICE, EMPLOYEE_ID, MANAGER, COUNTRY/CITY/STATE/STREET, ACCOUNT_ENABLED, USER_ACCOUNT_CONTROL, WHEN_CREATED, WHEN_MODIFIED, LAST_PWD_CHANGE_TIME, PASSWORD_EXPIRY_DATE, LAST_DIR_SYNC_TIME, O365_USER_TYPE, IS_LICENSED, GROUP_COUNT, LITIGATION_HOLD_ENABLED, AUDIT_ENABLED, SOFT_DELETION_TIMESTAMP | Cloud-side APF discovery for Entra. Used by [`UserDetailsUtil.getAADUserDetails()`](../../../REPOS/itsf/source/java_source/com/manageengine/itsf/common/incident/workbench/tab/util/UserDetailsUtil.java#L72). |

| OU Name | ✅ AD · ❌ Entra | `APFDiscADUserDetails.OU_NAME` directly (also `OU_DN_NAME`, `OU_UNIQUE_ID`). Entra has no OU concept (administrative units instead — `APFDiscAADUserDetails.GROUP_COUNT` is the closest signal). | Direct read | — |

| Account Status (with recommendation) | ✅ both (status) · 🤖 (recommendation) | Stored as pre-decoded BOOLEAN: `APFDiscADUserDetails.ACCOUNT_STATUS` — schema description is explicit: `0 → Disabled, 1 → Enabled`. The discovery handler resolves the `userAccountControl` disabled-bit during ingest (LDAP attr `uacAccountStatus`, [`APFADUserAttributes.xml` priority 18](../../../REPOS/ADSF-DD-DML/product_package/conf/adsf/common/appfw/applications/attributes/ad/APFADUserAttributes.xml#L18)) and writes the resolved boolean. Raw `USER_ACCOUNT_CONTROL` (BIGINT) is also retained for bits without their own column. Entra: `APFDiscAADUserDetails.ACCOUNT_ENABLED` (already a BOOLEAN per Graph API). The "Recommended: Disable" suffix is product-side business logic, not a stored column. | Direct read (BOOLEAN, no decoding needed) + AI for recommendation text | 🤖✚ AI generates the **recommendation text** ("Disable" / "Force password change") from current risk + attack chain |
| Logon Workstation | 🟡 both | **Two different concepts under one label** — see [§1.2.1](#121-logon-workstation--two-concepts-one-label) below. (a) **Allowlist (policy)** = `APFDiscADUserDetails.LOGON_TO` — direct read of LDAP `userWorkstations`, the workstations the AD admin permits this account to log on from. Usually empty (= all). (b) **Actual last logon from** (what the card shows as `CORP-WS-045`) = NOT on the user table at all — only in Windows Security event logs, requires ES query: `eventid=4624 \| stats latest(WorkstationName) by TargetUserName`. | (a) Direct read of `LOGON_TO` · (b) ES side-call (retention-bounded, typically 30/60/90 days) | — |
| Primary Group | ✅ AD (with join) · ❌ Entra | **One column + one join** — see [§1.2.2](#122-primary-group--one-column-one-join) below. `APFDiscADUserDetails` stores `PRIMARY_GROUP_ID` (the RID, e.g. `513`) and `PRIMARY_GROUP_GUID` (the group's OBJECT_GUID, manifest priority 100). Neither is the display name `"Domain Users"`. To resolve, join against [`APFDiscADGroupDetails`](../../../REPOS/ADSF-DD-DML/product_package/conf/adsf/common/appfw/discovery/application/ad/data-dictionary.xml) (same APF discovery, already in cloud schema) on `OBJECT_GUID = u.PRIMARY_GROUP_GUID`, return `GROUP_NAME`. Entra has no primary-group concept — `GROUP_COUNT` only; full membership lives in a separate APF group-membership table. | Direct read + 1 join | — |

> **Implication for the demo (corrected):** All 13 m.henderson User Details fields are now sourced from `APFDiscADUserDetails` directly with no two-table fallback needed for AD users. Only **two** caveats remain: (a) "Logon Workstation" on the card today shows `CORP-WS-045` which is "where m.henderson actually logged on from" — that's an ES side-call, **not** the `LOGON_TO` allowlist column. The doc should distinguish these. (b) For Entra-only tenants, **Last Logon Time** still requires an ES side-call into M365 SignInLogs (retention-bounded). For mixed tenants the slider should pick the path based on the discovered identity source.

#### 1.2.1 Logon Workstation — two concepts, one label

The single card label "Logon Workstation" conflates two unrelated things. They live in different stores and answer different questions:

| Concept | Question it answers | Where it lives | Cost |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Allowlist (policy)** | "Where is this account *permitted* to log on from?" | `APFDiscADUserDetails.LOGON_TO` — schema: `<column name="LOGON_TO"><description>userWorkstations</description><data-type>CHAR</data-type></column>`. Populated from LDAP `userWorkstations` (manifest priority 37). Static AD attribute set by the admin on the user object. **Usually empty** — meaning "allowed everywhere". | 1 indexed row read |
| **Actual last logon from** | "Where did this user *actually* log on from last?" | **Not** on any discovery table. Lives only in Windows Security event logs in Elasticsearch — `EventID 4624` (success) / `4625` (fail), fields `WorkstationName`, `IpAddress`, `IpPort`, `LogonType`. | 1 ES aggregation, **retention-bounded** (only as far back as ES retains 4624 events) |

**Resolution paths**

```sql
-- (a) Allowlist policy — direct read
SELECT LOGON_TO FROM APFDiscADUserDetails WHERE OBJECT_GUID = :userGuid;
```

```
# (b) Actual last logon from — ES query
index=wineventlog eventid=4624 TargetUserName="m.henderson"
| stats latest(WorkstationName) AS lastFromHost,
        latest(IpAddress)       AS lastFromIp
  by TargetUserName
```

**Why this matters for the card.** The demo today shows `CORP-WS-045` as "Logon Workstation". That value cannot come from `LOGON_TO` (that's the allowlist), it must come from ES `4624`. The two should be on separate rows on the card:

- **Last logon from:** `CORP-WS-045` (from ES 4624, retention-bounded)
- **Permitted from:** `LOGON_TO` value or `"All workstations"` (from discovery)

#### 1.2.2 Primary Group — one column, one join

`APFDiscADUserDetails` stores **two columns** related to the primary group, but neither is the display name a SOC analyst wants on the card:

```xml
<column name="PRIMARY_GROUP_ID">    <!-- e.g. "513" — the RID -->
<column name="PRIMARY_GROUP_GUID">  <!-- group's OBJECT_GUID, manifest priority 100 -->
```

`PRIMARY_GROUP_ID` is the AD primary-group RID (e.g. `513` = Domain Users, `512` = Domain Admins, `516` = Domain Controllers). It's just a number — useless on its own. To get `"Domain Users"` you join against [`APFDiscADGroupDetails`](../../../REPOS/ADSF-DD-DML/product_package/conf/adsf/common/appfw/discovery/application/ad/data-dictionary.xml), which is the AD groups table populated by the **same APF discovery** that fills `APFDiscADUserDetails`. Relevant columns on the groups table:

```
APFDiscADGroupDetails
├── OBJECT_GUID       -- group's GUID
├── SID_STRING        -- group's full SID (domain SID + RID)
├── GROUP_NAME        -- "Domain Users"   ← what the card shows
├── SAM_ACCOUNT_NAME  -- "Domain Users"
├── DISPLAY_NAME
└── APP_CONFIG_ID     -- same domain config as the user
```

**Resolution paths**

**Option A — via `PRIMARY_GROUP_GUID` (preferred, single clean join):**

```sql
SELECT g.GROUP_NAME
FROM   APFDiscADUserDetails u
JOIN   APFDiscADGroupDetails g
       ON g.OBJECT_GUID    = u.PRIMARY_GROUP_GUID
      AND g.APP_CONFIG_ID  = u.APP_CONFIG_ID
WHERE  u.OBJECT_GUID = :userGuid;
```

**Option B — via `PRIMARY_GROUP_ID` (RID) + SID match:** Only needed if `PRIMARY_GROUP_GUID` is null (older discoveries may not have populated it). Build the group's full SID by combining the user's domain SID prefix (from `u.SID_STRING`) with the RID, then match `g.SID_STRING`. Messier; prefer Option A.

**Why this isn't already pre-joined.** Look at the discovery schema — `APFDiscADUserDetails` and `APFDiscADGroupDetails` are **two separate tables with no FK between them**. The product keeps them denormalized because groups can be discovered before or after users; primary group is just a stored ID. The join is done at read time by whoever queries — in ADAP/ADManager the UI does this; on the cloud APF side the slider component does the same single join.

**Net.** Primary Group is **feasible with one join**, not impossible. The card just needs to show that the value `"Domain Users"` requires the user-row + groups-row join, not a single-column read.

## 8. EDGE RELATION Slider — Data Source & AI Enrichment Mapping

> **What it is**: When a user clicks an edge icon (📡 / 🔐 / 📁 / etc.) on the attack graph, a side slider opens with enriched connection details between two entities (e.g., `user-m-henderson → AccessedFile → svc-sharepoint`). This section maps every field shown to its backend source and AI-enrichable extension.
>
> **Interaction model**:
> - Click edge icon on graph → `showEdgeRelation(evt, el)` in [`js/v4-extras.js`](js/v4-extras.js#L341)
> - Source / target entity pills in the flow header are clickable → `openEntitySlider(id)`
> - Edge slider reuses the same DOM panel as the entity slider
>

## 9. Cross-Cutting AI-Enrichment Patterns

These are patterns **AI can apply to any field**, not specific to one entity:

| Pattern | Description | Example |
|---------|-------------|---------|
| **Live IOC enrichment** | On-demand call to VT/urlscan/Webroot/OTX/GreyNoise | Any IP/domain/hash field |
| **WHOIS / passive DNS** | Domain age, registrar, historical resolutions | Any domain field |
| **Geo + ASN enrichment** | MaxMind/IPinfo for any IP | Any IP field |
| **MITRE ATT&CK mapping** | Map raw event → tactic/technique/sub-technique | Any process/login/registry event |
| **Natural-language summarization** | Convert log noise into a narrative paragraph | Any timeline section |
| **Kill-chain reconstruction** | Order all alerts/events into a TTP timeline | `recentAlerts`, `correlatedAlerts` |
| **Verdict + recommendation generation** | Synthesize "Compromised / Insider / FP" + next steps | `riskSummary.statusBadge`, `remediationGuide` |
| **Rule explanation** | Translate detection rule → plain English | `triggerConditions` |
| **Anomaly rationale** | Explain *why* a `dot:'red'` was assigned | Any `dot` field in timelines |
| **Compliance evidence chain** | Map evidence → control IDs → notification text | `complianceImpact` |
| **Playbook ranking + pre-fill** | Pick best playbook, pre-fill variables | `remediationGuide.playbooks` |
| **Sensitivity classification** | Filename/path → PII/PCI/PHI label | `resourceFileAccess`, `sensitiveFiles` |
| **Toxic-combination detection** | Group memberships → privilege escalation chain | `identityRisk.privilegedGroups` |

## 11. Field-Status Summary

Across the V5 prototype:

| Status | Count (approx) | Notes |
|--------|----------------|-------|
| ✅ Available in product | ~80% | Most timeline/KV fields map to existing ES indices, AD attributes, M365 audit logs, or Sysmon events |
| 🟡 Partial / needs aggregation | ~12% | Mainly aggregator fields (peer-baseline %, threat-intel verdict aggregation) and compliance mappings |
| ❌ Not in product | ~5% | VirusTotal scores, domain age (WHOIS), AI-generated recommendations / verdicts |
| 🤖 AI-enrichable | **every section has at least one AI angle** | See §8 cross-cutting patterns |

---

## 12. Implementation Priority (AI-First)

If we ship AI augmentation, the highest-leverage fields to target first:

1. **Verdict + recommendations** (`statusBadge`, `remediationGuide.verdict`) — pure AI, no backend change, immediate UX win.
2. **`dot` rationale** — explain why each timeline entry is red/orange/green. Pure AI over already-collected data.
3. **Kill-chain narrative** for `recentAlerts` / `correlatedAlerts` — AI on existing alert links.
4. **Live IOC enrichment** for IP / domain / hash fields — adds VT, WHOIS, GreyNoise without backend changes.
5. **Compliance evidence + notification draft** (`complianceImpact`) — high analyst time-saver.
6. **Script deobfuscation** (`amsiEvents`) — AI reads encoded PowerShell content already collected, returns plain-English summary.
7. **Conditional Access "what-if"** — AI evaluates whether report-only policies would have stopped the attack.
8. **Playbook ranking + pre-fill** — AI picks the right playbook and fills variables.
